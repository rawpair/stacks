# RawPair Stacks

This repository provides official Docker images for development environments used with [RawPair](https://github.com/rawpair/rawpair). These stacks are designed for **collaborative, short-lived sessions**â€”where convenience matters more than minimalism.

Each image includes:
- A **full toolchain** for a specific language (e.g., Elixir, Ada, Prolog)
- **Sane defaults** and ready-to-use configuration
- Everything needed to get started without manual setup

These images are intended for **ephemeral, sandboxed sessions**, not public-facing or production deployments.

They prioritize **developer convenience** over strict hardening: full toolchains, common tools pre-installed, minimal setup required.  
This makes them ideal for short-lived environments where speed and simplicity matter mostâ€”like live coding, pair programming, or onboarding sessions.

They are **not security-hardened** for internet exposure or long-term persistence, and we strongly recommend against using them outside controlled environments.

## Required Components

To integrate properly with RawPair, each container **must include**:

- `bash` â€” shell consistency
- `tmux` â€” terminal multiplexing
- `supervisor` â€” process management
- `vector` â€” log streaming to the host
- `ttyd` â€” exposes the terminal over HTTP

These enable RawPair's real-time terminal access, session orchestration, and logging. Without them, your container **will not function correctly** inside the system.

---

## Required Config Files

Each image must also include three configuration files:

- `supervisord.conf`
- `ttyd-wrapper.sh`
- `vector.toml`

These are provided in the [docker/](https://github.com/rawpair/rawpair/tree/main/docker) folder of the main repo. You should copy them into your image during the build process.

## ðŸ’¡ Customizing Stacks

Youâ€™re free to build your own stacks, but make sure to keep the required components.  
In short: **build your own, but build smart.**

## Supported Tech Stacks

## Usage
Each Dockerfile is intended to be used by RawPair internally. You can also test them standalone:

Generates list of all possible permutations:

```bash
cd stacks
./build-images.sh --dry-run
```

Generates Elixir images:

```bash
cd stacks
./build-images.sh --filter=elixir
```
